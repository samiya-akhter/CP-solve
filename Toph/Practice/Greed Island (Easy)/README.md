## Problem Statement

**This is the easy version of the problem. There are differences between easy and hard version regarding constraints and problem statement. Read the statement carefully.**

Sajid Abdullah and Nirjoy Debnath are bored in a railway station. So they attempt to play the "Greed Island" game, in which they are handed an integer number line.

They are standing at a certain position x on this number line, and to win the game, they must move from their current position to a specified target position y.

They do not know how many moves are necessary to get to the target position. It is guaranteed that, x<y.

With just three magic cards, they can move from one place to another. Each card can be used **unlimited times**.

1. The Shadow card will transport them from x to (x+3)-th position in one operation.
2. The Light card will transport them from x to (x-2)-th position in one operation.
3. The Mist card will transport them from x to (x-1)-th position in one operation.

Print the minimum number of moves they need to reach the specific target position.

## Input

The first line contains one integer T (1 ≤ T ≤ 10), the number of test cases.

The next T lines contains two integers: x (-10⁹ ≤ x ≤ 10⁹), the position where Sajid and Nirjoy are currently standing, and y (-10⁹ ≤ y ≤ 10⁹), the target position they must reach to win the game.

## Output

Print the minimum number of moves they need to reach the specific target position.
