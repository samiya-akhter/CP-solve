## Problem Statement

You have to process $n$ tasks. Each task has a duration and a deadline, and you will process the tasks in some order one after another. Your reward for a task is $d-f$ where $d$ is its deadline and $f$ is your finishing time. (The starting time is $0$, and you have to process all tasks even if a task would yield negative reward.)

What is your maximum reward if you act optimally?

## Input

The first input line has an integer $n$: the number of tasks.

After this, there are $n$ lines that describe the tasks. Each line has two integers $a$ and $d$: the duration and deadline of the task.

## Output

Print one integer: the maximum reward.

## Constraints

- $1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10⁵$
- $1 ≤ a,d ≤ 10⁶$

## Examples

**Example:**

**Input:**
```
3
6 10
8 15
5 12
```

**Output:**
```
2
```
