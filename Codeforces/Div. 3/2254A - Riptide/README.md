Alice, Bob, and Charlie are playing a game with tokens. They start with `a`, `b`, and `c` tokens, respectively.

The game is played in rounds. Before the beginning of each round, they check the number of tokens everyone has:

 - If any two players have the exact same number of tokens, the game immediately ends.
- Otherwise, the round begins, all three players have a strictly different number of tokens. The player with the strictly most tokens gives exactly `1` token to the player with the strictly fewest tokens.

Given the starting tokens `a`, `b`, and `c`, determine exactly how many rounds the game will last before it ends.

## Input

The first line contains a single integer `t` (`1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3`) — the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of a single line containing three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` (`1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10`).

## Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of rounds the game will last before it ends.

## Examples

**Example:**

```
6
1 2 3
4 6 1
3 3 7
1 7 10
6 1 9
1 1 1
```

**Output:**

```
1
2
0
3
3
0
```

## Note

In the first test case: 

 - No two players have the same number of tokens.
- Charlie has the most tokens (`3` tokens), and Alice has the fewest tokens (`1` token). Therefore, Charlie gives Alice a token.
- Now, Alice has `2` tokens, Bob has `2` tokens, and Charlie has `2` tokens. Since there are two players (or more) with the same number of tokens, the game ends.

The game ended after `1` round, so the answer is `1`.

In the second test case, the game is played as follows: 

 - Bob gives Charlie a token, now Alice has `4` tokens, Bob has `5` tokens, and Charlie has `2` tokens.
- Bob gives Charlie a token, now Alice has `4` tokens, Bob has `4` tokens, and Charlie has `3` tokens. Since two players have the same number of tokens, the game ends.

The game lasted `2` rounds.

In the third test case, two players already have the same number of tokens. So the answer is `0` since no rounds were played.
