Alica and Bob are playing a game.

Initially they have a binary string `s` consisting of only characters `0` and `1`.

Alice and Bob make alternating moves: Alice makes the first move, Bob makes the second move, Alice makes the third one, and so on. During each move, the current player must choose two **different adjacent** characters of string `s` and delete them. For example, if `s = 1011001` then the following moves are possible: 

 - delete `s_1` and `s_2`: `1011001 arrow 11001`;
- delete `s_2` and `s_3`: `1011001 arrow 11001`;
- delete `s_4` and `s_5`: `1011001 arrow 10101`;
- delete `s_6` and `s_7`: `1011001 arrow 10110`.

If a player can't make any move, they lose. Both players play optimally. You have to determine if Alice can win.

## Input

First line contains one integer `t` (`1 ≤ t ≤ 1000`) — the number of test cases.

Only line of each test case contains one string `s` (`1 ≤ |s| ≤ 100`), consisting of only characters `0` and `1`.

## Output

For each test case print answer in the single line.

If Alice can win print `DA` (YES in Russian) in any register. Otherwise print `NET` (NO in Russian) in any register.

## Examples

**Example:**

```
3
01
1111
0011

```

**Output:**

```
DA
NET
NET

```

## Note

In the first test case after Alice's move string `s` become empty and Bob can not make any move.

In the second test case Alice can not make any move initially.

In the third test case after Alice's move string `s` turn into `01`. Then, after Bob's move string `s` become empty and Alice can not make any move.
