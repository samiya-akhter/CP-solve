You are given an array a of length n, consisting only of -1 and 1.

You may perform the following operation on a any number of times:

 - Choose an index i satisfying 1 ≤ i ≤ n - 1.
- Assign a_i = -a_i and a_i + 1 = -a_i + 1.

Determine whether it is possible to make the sum of elements of a equal to 0.

## Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 200). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the length of array a.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (a_i ∈ {-1, 1}) — the array a.

## Output

For each test case, print "`YES`" if it is possible to make the sum of elements of a equal to 0, and "`NO`" otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings "`yEs`", "`yes`", "`Yes`", and "`YES`" will be recognized as positive responses.

## Examples

**Example:**

```
5
1
-1
2
1 -1
2
1 1
5
1 -1 1 -1 1
6
-1 1 -1 -1 -1 -1
```

**Output:**

```
NO
YES
NO
NO
YES
```

## Note

In the first example, we cannot perform any operations, and the sum of elements of a equals -1 ≠ 0, so the answer is "`NO`".

In the second example, the sum of elements of a is already 0, so the answer is "`YES`".

In the fifth example, we can perform an operation with i = 3, transforming a as follows: [-1, 1, colorred-1, -1, -1, -1] arrow [-1, 1, colorred1, 1, -1, -1]. The sum of the resulting array is 0, so the answer is "`YES`".
